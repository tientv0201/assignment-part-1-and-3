### Config and Setup
First we need to create a db.json file like the problem.
Install postman (https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
Install json-server ```
npm i json-server```
Run json-server ```
json-server ---watch db.json``` 
We can open http://localhost:3000 to test API

### Open and Test API with Postman

We need to open Postman and import file collection and environment in Postman
Collection file ```Assignment_Part_3.postman_collection.json```
Environment file ```Environment Test Local.postman_environment.json```

I have separated this exercise into 2 folders:
- Test case of Create New User
- Write flow test API

To perform the test, open the Runner tap -> Drag the folder -> Start Run
